node-openzwave
==============

This is a node.js add-on which wraps the
[OpenZWave](https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/) library to provide access to
a ZWave network from JavaScript.

It is currently non-functional, but does build an add-on which contains the
openzwave library and is able to instantiate a new manager.
